**Basic Tools** is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that showcases three interactive web-based tools: a Timer/Stopwatch, a To-Do List, and a calculator.
Each tool is built to demonstrate a core JavaScript concept while also highlighting clean HTML structure and responsive CSS styling. This project is part of my learning journey in front-end web development.

## 🔧 Features
### ⏲️ Timer & Stopwatch
- Set custom timers using hours, minutes, and seconds
- Start, stop, and reset stopwatch functionality
- Audio or visual alert when timer ends
- **JavaScript Skills**: Time-based functions, setTimeout, setInterval, event handling, working with external libraries

### ✅ To-Do List
- - Add, delete, and manage tasks
  - Create organized and dynamic task lists
  - **JavaScript Skills:** Object manipulation, array methods, DOM interaction, event listeners

### 🧮 Calculator
- Perform basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus
- Button-based input with live output
- **JavaScript Skills:** Operators, conditional logic, state handling, event delegation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** - for page structure
- **CSS3** - for responsive and user-friendly styling
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** - for logic and interactivity

## ☝️🤓 What I learned
This project helped reinforce:
- Buiding responsive layouts using HTML and CSS
- Connecting logic with UI through DOM manipulation
- Applying JavaScript fundamentals like event handling, objects, functions and operators
- Debugging and problem-solving across different mini applications
