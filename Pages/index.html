            <div class="div-para">
                <i><b>Basic Tools</b></i> is a beginner-level Javascript website that combines three
                interactive mini-projects into a single platform. Each project is designed to demonstrate specific
                Javascript concepts such as working with libraries, manipulating objects, and using operators.
                This project also highlights my ability to structure and style responsive web pages using HTML and CSS,
                integrating them with dynamic Javascript functionality. Together, these tools reflect my growing
                understanding
                of front-end development and my ability to build functional, user-friendly interfaces. Below is a
                breakdown
                of the key concepts each tool focuses on:
            </div>
            <!-- Column and Rows -->
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column div-titles">
                    <img src="../images/calculator.png" />
                    <h2>Functional Calculator</h2>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        This calculator project teaches me how to use Javascript operators
                        and handle user input through buttons. It supports basic arithmetic, including modulus, and
                        reinforces
                        logic building and real-time calculations.

                </div>
                <div class="column div-titles">
                    <img src="../images/to-do-list.png" />
                    <h2>To-Do List</h2>
                    <div class="div-container">
                        In this project, I'm focusing on Javascript objects and DOM manipulation.
                        Users can add, delete and organize tasks, which helps me handling dynamic data
                        and creating interactive user interfaces.
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h2>Timer & StopWatch</h2>
                    <div class=" div-container">
                    This project helps me learn how to use Javascript libraries and manage time-based functions.
                    It includes a customizable timer and a stopwatch with start, stop and reset functionality,
                    along
                    with alerts to notify when time is up.

    - In the navbar, I will display the time and date. It will not display seconds
        //Will also display the name of the website
    - Options to switch between different tools
        // Calculator
        // To-do List
        // Timer
2. Timer/Stopwatch (Learning libraries)
    - Allows for the user to set a timer based on whatever numbers they put: hours :: Minutes :: Seconds, Will also include a start and a signal to let the user know the timer is up
    - Stopwatch will include a stop, start, reset.
    - Will Display the time and date as the first on the page
3. To-do list (Learning objects) (DONE)
    - User will be allowed to add, delete and create lists
    - Will require buttons for each
4. Calculator (Learning Operators)
    - Will allow for all operators to happen based on buttons clicked.
    - Will include Modulus
5. OPTIMIZATION
    - At the end of the prject I will go back and optimize my code, research the best modern practices in Javascript to keep my code clean and professional
    following industries standards
